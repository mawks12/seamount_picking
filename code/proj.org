* Fixing hidden seamounts?
** Use minumum possible gaussian kernal size?
 - Alternatively, use small enough kernel to only get very small seamounts and then filter out large seamounts afterwords, since it can be assumed that those seamounts are already detected
   - NOTE this will fail on edge cases where seamounts are very close to each other
** How to Identify scaling
 - Select minumum seamount size and use this parameter?
** Using blockmedian
- Use grdmedian in order to get the median seafloor depth at any given point and try reprocessing after multiplying by this value
 [[file:global_seamounts.py::def scale_input(depth_p, data: xr.xarray):][Function for the blockmedian scaling]]
 - Also Add some way to scale kernel size such that it coresponds to depth?
   Function is not passed the model so this would need to be generated and saved somewhere else for the next step to process it
